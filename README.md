### Early Days

---

&emsp;&emsp;I've been learning about programming for over ten years, since way back in middle-school. It all started when I wanted to add content to a video-game that I played with my friends, and quickly evolved into making my own games. From humble beginnings in _TorqueScript_ I dabbled with _HTML_ and _CSS_ in _Adobe Dreamweaver_, but finally settled on _Boo_ and the _Unity3D_ engine just before its upgrade to version 3.0.

&emsp;&emsp;My early games involved throwing coconuts into volcanos, hang-gliding, and attempts to copy popular AAA titles from the time, but as I learned more about programming, I found myself migrating to the more powerful C# (which _Unity3D_ also supported) and trying to make software that improved peoples' lives. I made a friend along the way, and together we developed a music player to rival iTunes. Or, at least, my mom liked it.

&emsp;&emsp;_UnityMusicPlayer_ is what I consider to be my first successful project, and I'm proud of bringing it from inception to sunset. Please see the Explanations of Projects section below for its details, but in short, _UMP_ supported several audio formats, music organization, real-time audio visualization, and an online ecosystem for downloading music that artists volunteered to share. _UnityMusicPlayer_ was also a turning point in my development as a person.
